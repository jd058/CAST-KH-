Declass One (1996)

On February 24, 1995, President Clinton signed an Executive Order, directing the declassification of intelligence imagery acquired by the first generation of United States photo-reconnaissance satellites, including the systems code-named CORONA, ARGON, and LANYARD. More than 860,000 images of Earth's surface, collected between 1960 and 1972, were declassified with the issuance of this Executive Order. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) was given the responsibility for the original film and provide access to a duplicate copy for public viewing of the film. The USGS was also provided a duplicate copy to support science products. Both NARA and the USGS provide access and product support for the Declass-1 collection. Online requests for these data can be placed via the EarthExplorer interactive query system. EarthExplorer contains metadata and online samples of Earth science data. With EarthExplorer, you may review metadata, determine product availability, and place online requests for products. More than 40 percent of the imagery contains significant cloud cover. The use of browse imagery gives the user the opportunity to review a reduced spatial resolution image to determine whether or not the area of interest is covered and is or is not obscured by clouds.

Declassified photographs from U.S. intelligence satellites provide an important worldwide addition to the public record of the Earth’s land surface. This imagery was released to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in accordance with Executive Order 12951 on February 23, 1995. The NARA has the original declassified film and a viewing copy. The USGS has another copy of the film to complement the Landsat archive. The declassified collection involves more than 990,000 photographs taken from 1959 through 1980 and was released on two separate occasions: February 1995 (Declass 1) and September 2002 (Declass 2). The USGS copy is maintained by the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center, near Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Both the NARA and EROS provide public access to this unique collection that extends the record of land-surface change back another decade from the advent of the Landsat program that began satellite operations in 1972.

**CORONA** (1959-1972): The first successful CORONA mission was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in 1960.

It’s hard to imagine a world without Google maps or satellite imagery, but when CORONA was developed in the 1950s, satellite photo-reconnaissance didn’t exist. CORONA was created by a small group of CIA, Air Force, and private industry experts who were tasked with finding a way to provide broad imagery coverage of the USSR to identify missile launch sites and production facilities. President Dwight D. Eisenhower formally endorsed CORONA in February 1958. Known to the public as the U.S. Air Force’s Discoverer program, the classified CORONA project operated during the height of the Cold War to collect pictures over the denied areas of eastern Europe and Asia. CORONA also had sister programs: ARGON for mapping imagery and LANYARD, a short-lived program designed for higher-quality imagery.

`	`CORONA contained multiple mission designators for multiple payloads while ARGON and LANYARD each only had one of their own. The CORONA satellites were designated KH-1, KH-2, KH-3, KH-4, KH-4A, and KH-4B. KH stood for "Key Hole" or "Keyhole" (Code number 1010), with the name being an analogy to the act of spying into a person's room by peering through their door's keyhole. ARGON’s satellite was the KH-5, while respectively, the following mission’s designator for LANYARD was the KH-6. The incrementing number indicated changes in the surveillance instrumentation, such as the change from single-panoramic to double-panoramic cameras. There were 144 CORONA satellites launched, of which 102 returned usable photographs.

`	`**ARGON** (1961-1964):  KH-5 ARGON was a series of reconnaissance satellites produced by the United States from February 1961 to August 1964. The KH-5 operated similarly to the CORONA series of satellites, as it ejected a canister of photographic film. At least 12 missions were attempted, but at least 7 had errors and failed. Lockheed manufactured the satellite. Launches used Thor-Agena launch vehicles flying from Vandenberg Air Force Base, with the payload being integrated into the Agena, an American rocket upper stage and satellite bus which was developed by Lockheed Corporation initially for the canceled WS-117L reconnaissance satellite program.

`	`CORONA started under the name "Discoverer" as part of the WS-117L satellite reconnaissance and protection program of the U.S. Air Force in 1956. The WS-117L was based on recommendations and designs from the RAND Corporation. The program's primary goal was to develop a film-return photographic satellite to replace the U-2 spyplane in surveilling the Sino-Soviet Bloc. The difference in ARGON is that a major collaborator was Lockheed martin instead of the RAND Corporation. The essence of the missions however was fundamentally the same.

**LANYARD** (1961-1964): KH-6 LANYARD was an early attempt to develop and gain higher resolution imagery, which flew one successful mission in 1963. The satellites were designed to de-orbit a film capsule (referred to as a "bucket") from space with mid-air recovery of the returning capsule by a specially equipped aircraft. Early systems operated with a single bucket. The spacecraft had a maximum diameter of 5 feet or 60 inches with a total Agena-D length of 20.86 feet and a total spacecraft Agena-D rocket stage length of about 35.6 feet. It was launched by the Thrust Augmented Thor Agena-D booster into an inclination of 65.82 degrees and with a perigee of 134.84 miles and an apogee of 229.30 miles. It was designed to carry some sub-satellites science payloads but no solar arrays for longer duration missions. It utilized the usual allotment of sun earth and horizon sensors with one General Electric film return capsule.

The KH-6 LANYARD Kodak advanced lens drive scanning Optical Bar camera system with its forward tilting primary mirror and folding optics created images on large format 5 inch wide film. The KH-6 camera was not the full development of its potential and needed considerable refinements that were introduced with the KH-7 camera. This system produced images with a resolution between 60 and 24 inches. LANYARD had a very significant technical issue with lateral aiming of the camera which was not identified until later. The issue was similar to the KH-7 camera problem "If one target was directly under the satellite it could be difficult or impossible to move the camera to a target off to the side in the limited time available to get a picture before the spacecraft was out of range. As a result, the KH-7 was 'access limited' and the satellites usually finished their missions with unused film because the consumables needed to keep the spacecraft in orbit ran out before the film" (Richelson, J. "America's Secret Eyes in Space." New York : Ballinger, 1990, p 78.)
